# SnowVault - EERC Privacy Platform

A comprehensive privacy-first blockchain platform built on Avalanche, enabling confidential transactions, lending, payroll management, DAO governance, and real-world asset tokenization.

## Features

### 🔒 Privacy-First Architecture
- Zero-knowledge proofs for confidential transactions
- Selective disclosure mechanisms
- Regulatory compliance with auditable privacy

### 💰 DeFi Protocols
- **Confidential Lending**: Private lending and borrowing with ZK-proofs
- **Private Payroll**: Secure employee compensation management
- **DAO Governance**: Anonymous voting and proposal systems
- **RWA Tokenization**: Real-world asset tokenization with privacy

### 🛠 Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain**: Avalanche, Solidity Smart Contracts
- **Privacy**: Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-SNARKs)
- **Development**: Hardhat, ethers.js

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask or compatible wallet

## Smart Contracts

The platform includes several smart contracts for different functionalities:

- **PrivacyToken**: ERC-20 compatible token with privacy features
- **ConfidentialLending**: Lending protocol with ZK-proof integration
- **PrivatePayroll**: Employee compensation with privacy protection
- **ConfidentialDAO**: Anonymous governance and voting
- **RWATokenization**: Real-world asset tokenization
